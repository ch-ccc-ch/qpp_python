In any case, in the EU the principle of unanimity governed complex matters, and the qualified majority vote was decisive for issues concerning the internal market, Kinkel told the DDP/ADN news agency in Nuremberg.

Kinkel rejected criticism from the CSU [Christian Social Union]-led Bavarian Government to the effect that German interests were not being represented at national and international level as matter of factly as other countries.

The chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Ignatz Bubis, has called for the search for the \"mental instigators.\" How do you assess this attack? [Mor] Of course, we assess it in the same way as Mr. Bubis and all other politicians who have commented on the attack so far. Israel is observing with close attention what is happening in Germany in the sphere of radicalism and anti-Semitism. Like everybody else in Germany, we are naturally concerned. [Wiese] Is this attack a confirmation of your fears -- of the fear that a new anti-Semitism is emerging in Germany? [Mor] Well, anti-Semitism exists in Germany anyway and, unfortunately, everywhere else in the world. Every now and then -- not to say regularly -- our fears are confirmed. This is naturally a big cause for concern. We are confident that the German authorities will do everything possible to prevent such events. Unfortunately, such incidents still occur. This is very, very bad. [Wiese] Mr. Mor, how do you assess the measures that are being taken in Germany against the danger for Jewish institutions and the danger for foreigners? Do you think that the measures are sufficient? [Mor] Well, I am not in a position to make such an assessment. However, the Israeli Government and the Israeli citizens in Israel are confident that the German authorities are doing everything possible to protect the foreigners and other minorities in Germany and to prevent such incidents. Emnid published the results of an opinion poll a few days ago. A total of 22 percent do not want a Jewish neighbor. This is very telling. [Wiese] Mr. Mor, you just talked about possible Israeli reactions to events in Germany. Is Israel concerned about incidents like the one that just happened in Luebeck? [Mor] Yes, of course. As I just said, for us this is a big cause for concern. We are convinced that Weimar is not possible in Germany today. However, a total of 40,000 Jews and other minorities are living in Germany. There are numerous foreigners in Germany who would like to be protected. Of course, we all must do everything possible to provide such protection. As I just mentioned, Israel is closely following what is happening in Germany. Anti-Semitism and right-wing extremism naturally exist all over the world. However, against the backdrop of the events of 1933 and 1945, such events assume great significance because they are occuring in Germany of all countries. [Wiese] Thank you, Mr. Mor. Good bye.

Although he stopped short of direct criticism of Turkey's campaign against Kurdish guerrillas and civilians, which caused Germany to suspend all arms shipments last week, he said that Ankara must observe all its commitments to human and minority rights. In a parliamentary debate on the row between the two normally close allies, Mr Kohl sought to turn the debacle to belated electoral advantage. With an eye on the state elections in Baden-Wurttemberg and Schleswig-Holstein on Sunday, the chancellor delivered a ringing defence of his government's foreign policy. But Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, the SPD parliamentary leader, taunted Mr Kohl for allowing the row to get out of hand. He said that Mr Dick Cheney, the US defence secretary, had been forced to intervene between the Nato partners. 'We have reached a sorry state when our big brother in the alliance, the US, must help us to return to the path of foreign policy virtue,' he said. The number of foreigners seeking political asylum in Germany reached a record of more than 35,000 last month, with refugees from Yugoslavia alone running at 13,175. Romania was the second largest source, with 5,544 and Turkey third with 2,406. Turkey is to introduce economic reforms for the impoverished Kurdish minority after unrest in the area in which more than 100 have died in the past 10 days, writes John Murray Brown in Ankara. The measures represent the first concrete steps to address the Kurdish problem and stem growing support for the Syrian backed Kurdish Workers Party which is fighting an eight year campaign for independence. The Financial Times London Page 2\", \"Document 4 : FT941-1403 _AN-ECYC5ACZFT 940325 FT 25 MAR 94 / Major looks to Germany for EU deal By LIONEL BARBER, PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID GARDNER BRUSSELS, LONDON The government is looking to Germany to forge a face-saving compromise in the dispute over voting rights which risks delaying the entry of four new countries into the European Union next year. After Mr John Major dropped hints of flexibility in the UK negotiating position yesterday, senior British officials expressed hope that Germany might be able to coax EU partners into reciprocal movement at this weekend's meeting of European foreign ministers in Greece. Germany has opposed UK and Spanish demands to preserve voting rules allowing two large member states and one small country to block decisions in the Council of Ministers. The UK, however, appears to be gambling that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's desire to bring Finland, Sweden, Austria and Norway into the EU may encourage new flexibility. Even if the deadlock is not broken in Greece, one wellplaced UK official said it might be possible to reach a deal before Easter. Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, said after a meeting with Mr Alain Juppe, his French counterpart, that any deal must not come at the price of weakened decision-making in an expanded EU. Hopes of a compromise revolve around a trade-off in which the UK and Spain concede that the 'blocking minority' must rise from 23 to 27 votes to take account of the four new members. In return they would win a legally binding protocol giving countries mustering between 23 and 27 votes an automatic right to delay decisions. Mr Major's 'bottom line' was described by senior Whitehall insiders as an agreement which in no way eroded the ability of minorities to block contentious legislation on employment and social issues. Legal experts in Brussels dismissed the notion of putting a legal ring-fence around social legislation, or creating a two-tier voting system to deal with such contentious issues. Mr Major told the Commons that an agreement would be possible 'within a matter of days' if other European governments had the political will to reach a settlement. David Gardner in Brussels adds: Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek European affairs minister, who will be chairing this weekend's meeting in Greece, last night described the British stance as 'the blackmail of a tiny minority'.

Therefore, there is no alternative at all to further support for President Yeltsin. If stability and economic progress is achieved there, the whole of Europe will benefit from it. Russia must be fully integrated within the world economy, where the division of labor exists, which also applies to the other CIS states. In particular, Kinkel mentions Ukraine, whose government he requests to accede to the Nonproliferation Treaty. Then the minister spoke about his recent meeting with the three Baltic ministers in Bonn: Of course, the three Baltic states are a special concern for us. Ties in the Baltic area that have been buried for years have to be revived again. Of all former Soviet republics, the Baltic states can show the most impressive reform successes. Yes, the dimensions are small, but they are nevertheless impressive. One objective of our presidency in the second half of the year will be to conclude an association agreement with the prospect of association also with Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. The talks that I held with the three Baltic foreign ministers in the past few days focused on leading these states to the European Union [EU]. Politically and economically stable Baltic countries are an advantage for the whole of the region, and, by the way, also for Russia. It is the priority task of the European policy of these days to join the parts of Europe that have been separated for more than four decades. It presents particular challenges to Germany, the country in the center. We are particularly affected by all the risks, but, on the other hand, especially favored with the chances, too. Since the end of 1989, we have particularly supported the reform states in Central and East Europe. However, the historic chance that lies ahead of us, that is, to help the chances of freedom in our east to be transformed into jobs and thus into permanent political institutions, far exceeds Germany\\'s powers. Also for this reason, it is so important that the EU continues to advance consistently on the road toward its enlargement, as was outlined in Copenhagen. Of course, the European-Atlantic institutions must not be overstrained or overtaxed when stability is extended to Central and East Europe. This would not help those who want to become members, either. Therefore, we have to beware of a course of action that only permits the choice between entry and isolation. The right course is a flexible system of increasingly close pan-European cooperation in addition to the option of entry. I do not want to fail to mention the Foreign Ministry\\'s cultural promotion for the German minorities in Central and East Europe. For example, several representations were newly established in regions with German minorities. The foreign representations in Almaty, Bishkek, Tashkent, Gdansk, Szczecin, and soon Novosibirsk and Saratov are dedicating a considerable part of their work to the concerns of the German minority in their administrative districts. This is good and very important. Help for self-help, from the training and advanced training of teachers through syllabuses and textbooks to media promotion, is primarily the issue here. With this policy, we want to build additional bridges to these countries through our minorities, but we do not want to create artificial loyalty problems. We must not forget one thing: Europe is more than growth figures and foreign trade statistics and also more than the mere maximization of affluence. Europe is a cultural area. Whoever wants to put it together again has to restart above all the intellectual-cultural exchange. A tremendous amount of things still have to be done in this respect. Personally, I very much deplore the fact that we have relatively few funds for this purpose at a time when we have problems and difficulties. Above all I deplore it so much because we -- this has often been said in the Bundestag -- have an enormous chance as far as our language is concerned. It is not unimportant for the Germans -- it is particularly striking for me as their foreign minister -- that colleagues, friends, and partners who speak German come from these countries to the numerous conferences that we hold and where French and English have hitherto been the only languages. This is a chance that we should use. I ask the German Bundestag again to help me when money is at issue and to give a proper impetus. [passage omitted]']\n"

It is the priority task of the European policy of these days to join the parts of Europe that have been separated for more than four decades. It presents particular challenges to Germany, the country in the center. We are particularly affected by all the risks, but, on the other hand, especially favored with the chances, too. Since the end of 1989, we have particularly supported the reform states in Central and East Europe. However, the historic chance that lies ahead of us, that is, to help the chances of freedom in our east to be transformed into jobs and thus into permanent political institutions, far exceeds Germany\\'s powers. Also for this reason, it is so important that the EU continues to advance consistently on the road toward its enlargement, as was outlined in Copenhagen. Of course, the European-Atlantic institutions must not be overstrained or overtaxed when stability is extended to Central and East Europe. This would not help those who want to become members, either. Therefore, we have to beware of a course of action that only permits the choice between entry and isolation. The right course is a flexible system of increasingly close pan-European cooperation in addition to the option of entry. I do not want to fail to mention the Foreign Ministry\\'s cultural promotion for the German minorities in Central and East Europe. For example, several representations were newly established in regions with German minorities. The foreign representations in Almaty, Bishkek, Tashkent, Gdansk, Szczecin, and soon Novosibirsk and Saratov are dedicating a considerable part of their work to the concerns of the German minority in their administrative districts. This is good and very important. Help for self-help, from the training and advanced training of teachers through syllabuses and textbooks to media promotion, is primarily the issue here. With this policy, we want to build additional bridges to these countries through our minorities, but we do not want to create artificial loyalty problems. We must not forget one thing: Europe is more than growth figures and foreign trade statistics and also more than the mere maximization of affluence. Europe is a cultural area. Whoever wants to put it together again has to restart above all the intellectual-cultural exchange. A tremendous amount of things still have to be done in this respect. Personally, I very much deplore the fact that we have relatively few funds for this purpose at a time when we have problems and difficulties. Above all I deplore it so much because we -- this has often been said in the Bundestag -- have an enormous chance as far as our language is concerned. It is not unimportant for the Germans -- it is particularly striking for me as their foreign minister -- that colleagues, friends, and partners who speak German come from these countries to the numerous conferences that we hold and where French and English have hitherto been the only languages. This is a chance that we should use. I ask the German Bundestag again to help me when money is at issue and to give a proper impetus. [passage omitted]']"
