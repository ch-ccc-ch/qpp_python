In any case, in the EU the principle of unanimity governed complex matters, and the qualified majority vote was decisive for issues concerning the internal market, Kinkel told the DDP/ADN news agency in Nuremberg. Moreover, the EU foreign ministers had undertaken to reexamine the whole procedure, which has now been decided, in 1996. It had at any rate been right not to let the accession of the Scandinavian countries and Austria collapse over this matter, Kinkel said. Kinkel rejected criticism from the CSU [Christian Social Union]-led Bavarian Government to the effect that German interests were not being represented at national and international level as matter of factly as other countries. In view of its past, Germany was being \"viewed critically\" as a reunited country, Kinkel said.

[Mor] Good day, Mr. Wiese. [Wiese] Mr. Mor, the attack on the synagogue in Luebeck has caused great outrage. The chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Ignatz Bubis, has called for the search for the \"mental instigators.\" How do you assess this attack? [Mor] Of course, we assess it in the same way as Mr. Bubis and all other politicians who have commented on the attack so far. Israel is observing with close attention what is happening in Germany in the sphere of radicalism and anti-Semitism. Like everybody else in Germany, we are naturally concerned. [Wiese] Is this attack a confirmation of your fears -- of the fear that a new anti-Semitism is emerging in Germany? [Mor] Well, anti-Semitism exists in Germany anyway and, unfortunately, everywhere else in the world. Every now and then -- not to say regularly -- our fears are confirmed. This is naturally a big cause for concern. We are confident that the German authorities will do everything possible to prevent such events. Unfortunately, such incidents still occur. This is very, very bad. [Wiese] Mr. Mor, how do you assess the measures that are being taken in Germany against the danger for Jewish institutions and the danger for foreigners? Do you think that the measures are sufficient? [Mor] Well, I am not in a position to make such an assessment. However, the Israeli Government and the Israeli citizens in Israel are confident that the German authorities are doing everything possible to protect the foreigners and other minorities in Germany and to prevent such incidents. Emnid published the results of an opinion poll a few days ago. A total of 22 percent do not want a Jewish neighbor. This is very telling. [Wiese] Mr. Mor, you just talked about possible Israeli reactions to events in Germany. Is Israel concerned about incidents like the one that just happened in Luebeck? [Mor] Yes, of course. As I just said, for us this is a big cause for concern. We are convinced that Weimar is not possible in Germany today. However, a total of 40,000 Jews and other minorities are living in Germany. There are numerous foreigners in Germany who would like to be protected. Of course, we all must do everything possible to provide such protection. As I just mentioned, Israel is closely following what is happening in Germany. Anti-Semitism and right-wing extremism naturally exist all over the world. However, against the backdrop of the events of 1933 and 1945, such events assume great significance because they are occuring in Germany of all countries. [Wiese] Thank you, Mr. Mor. Good bye.

Although he stopped short of direct criticism of Turkey's campaign against Kurdish guerrillas and civilians, which caused Germany to suspend all arms shipments last week, he said that Ankara must observe all its commitments to human and minority rights. In a parliamentary debate on the row between the two normally close allies, Mr Kohl sought to turn the debacle to belated electoral advantage. With an eye on the state elections in Baden-Wurttemberg and Schleswig-Holstein on Sunday, the chancellor delivered a ringing defence of his government's foreign policy. But Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, the SPD parliamentary leader, taunted Mr Kohl for allowing the row to get out of hand. He said that Mr Dick Cheney, the US defence secretary, had been forced to intervene between the Nato partners. 'We have reached a sorry state when our big brother in the alliance, the US, must help us to return to the path of foreign policy virtue,' he said. The number of foreigners seeking political asylum in Germany reached a record of more than 35,000 last month, with refugees from Yugoslavia alone running at 13,175. Romania was the second largest source, with 5,544 and Turkey third with 2,406. Turkey is to introduce economic reforms for the impoverished Kurdish minority after unrest in the area in which more than 100 have died in the past 10 days, writes John Murray Brown in Ankara. The measures represent the first concrete steps to address the Kurdish problem and stem growing support for the Syrian backed Kurdish Workers Party which is fighting an eight year campaign for independence. The Financial Times London Page 2\", \"Document 4 : FT941-1403 _AN-ECYC5ACZFT 940325 FT 25 MAR 94 / Major looks to Germany for EU deal By LIONEL BARBER, PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID GARDNER BRUSSELS, LONDON The government is looking to Germany to forge a face-saving compromise in the dispute over voting rights which risks delaying the entry of four new countries into the European Union next year. After Mr John Major dropped hints of flexibility in the UK negotiating position yesterday, senior British officials expressed hope that Germany might be able to coax EU partners into reciprocal movement at this weekend's meeting of European foreign ministers in Greece. Germany has opposed UK and Spanish demands to preserve voting rules allowing two large member states and one small country to block decisions in the Council of Ministers. The UK, however, appears to be gambling that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's desire to bring Finland, Sweden, Austria and Norway into the EU may encourage new flexibility. Even if the deadlock is not broken in Greece, one wellplaced UK official said it might be possible to reach a deal before Easter. Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, said after a meeting with Mr Alain Juppe, his French counterpart, that any deal must not come at the price of weakened decision-making in an expanded EU. Hopes of a compromise revolve around a trade-off in which the UK and Spain concede that the 'blocking minority' must rise from 23 to 27 votes to take account of the four new members. In return they would win a legally binding protocol giving countries mustering between 23 and 27 votes an automatic right to delay decisions. Mr Major's 'bottom line' was described by senior Whitehall insiders as an agreement which in no way eroded the ability of minorities to block contentious legislation on employment and social issues. Legal experts in Brussels dismissed the notion of putting a legal ring-fence around social legislation, or creating a two-tier voting system to deal with such contentious issues. Mr Major told the Commons that an agreement would be possible 'within a matter of days' if other European governments had the political will to reach a settlement. David Gardner in Brussels adds: Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek European affairs minister, who will be chairing this weekend's meeting in Greece, last night described the British stance as 'the blackmail of a tiny minority'.

Therefore, there is no alternative at all to further support for President Yeltsin. If stability and economic progress is achieved there, the whole of Europe will benefit from it. Russia must be fully integrated within the world economy, where the division of labor exists, which also applies to the other CIS states. In particular, Kinkel mentions Ukraine, whose government he requests to accede to the Nonproliferation Treaty. Then the minister spoke about his recent meeting with the three Baltic ministers in Bonn: Of course, the three Baltic states are a special concern for us. Ties in the Baltic area that have been buried for years have to be revived again. Of all former Soviet republics, the Baltic states can show the most impressive reform successes. Yes, the dimensions are small, but they are nevertheless impressive. One objective of our presidency in the second half of the year will be to conclude an association agreement with the prospect of association also with Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. The talks that I held with the three Baltic foreign ministers in the past few days focused on leading these states to the European Union [EU]. Politically and economically stable Baltic countries are an advantage for the whole of the region, and, by the way, also for Russia. It is the priority task of the European policy of these days to join the parts of Europe that have been separated for more than four decades. It presents particular challenges to Germany, the country in the center. We are particularly affected by all the risks, but, on the other hand, especially favored with the chances, too. Since the end of 1989, we have particularly supported the reform states in Central and East Europe. However, the historic chance that lies ahead of us, that is, to help the chances of freedom in our east to be transformed into jobs and thus into permanent political institutions, far exceeds Germany\\'s powers. Also for this reason, it is so important that the EU continues to advance consistently on the road toward its enlargement, as was outlined in Copenhagen. Of course, the European-Atlantic institutions must not be overstrained or overtaxed when stability is extended to Central and East Europe. This would not help those who want to become members, either. Therefore, we have to beware of a course of action that only permits the choice between entry and isolation. The right course is a flexible system of increasingly close pan-European cooperation in addition to the option of entry. I do not want to fail to mention the Foreign Ministry\\'s cultural promotion for the German minorities in Central and East Europe. For example, several representations were newly established in regions with German minorities. The foreign representations in Almaty, Bishkek, Tashkent, Gdansk, Szczecin, and soon Novosibirsk and Saratov are dedicating a considerable part of their work to the concerns of the German minority in their administrative districts. This is good and very important. Help for self-help, from the training and advanced training of teachers through syllabuses and textbooks to media promotion, is primarily the issue here. With this policy, we want to build additional bridges to these countries through our minorities, but we do not want to create artificial loyalty problems. We must not forget one thing: Europe is more than growth figures and foreign trade statistics and also more than the mere maximization of affluence. Europe is a cultural area. Whoever wants to put it together again has to restart above all the intellectual-cultural exchange. A tremendous amount of things still have to be done in this respect. Personally, I very much deplore the fact that we have relatively few funds for this purpose at a time when we have problems and difficulties. Above all I deplore it so much because we -- this has often been said in the Bundestag -- have an enormous chance as far as our language is concerned. It is not unimportant for the Germans -- it is particularly striking for me as their foreign minister -- that colleagues, friends, and partners who speak German come from these countries to the numerous conferences that we hold and where French and English have hitherto been the only languages. This is a chance that we should use. I ask the German Bundestag again to help me when money is at issue and to give a proper impetus. [passage omitted]']\n"

It is the priority task of the European policy of these days to join the parts of Europe that have been separated for more than four decades. It presents particular challenges to Germany, the country in the center. We are particularly affected by all the risks, but, on the other hand, especially favored with the chances, too. Since the end of 1989, we have particularly supported the reform states in Central and East Europe. However, the historic chance that lies ahead of us, that is, to help the chances of freedom in our east to be transformed into jobs and thus into permanent political institutions, far exceeds Germany\\'s powers. Also for this reason, it is so important that the EU continues to advance consistently on the road toward its enlargement, as was outlined in Copenhagen. Of course, the European-Atlantic institutions must not be overstrained or overtaxed when stability is extended to Central and East Europe. This would not help those who want to become members, either. Therefore, we have to beware of a course of action that only permits the choice between entry and isolation. The right course is a flexible system of increasingly close pan-European cooperation in addition to the option of entry. I do not want to fail to mention the Foreign Ministry\\'s cultural promotion for the German minorities in Central and East Europe. For example, several representations were newly established in regions with German minorities. The foreign representations in Almaty, Bishkek, Tashkent, Gdansk, Szczecin, and soon Novosibirsk and Saratov are dedicating a considerable part of their work to the concerns of the German minority in their administrative districts. This is good and very important. Help for self-help, from the training and advanced training of teachers through syllabuses and textbooks to media promotion, is primarily the issue here. With this policy, we want to build additional bridges to these countries through our minorities, but we do not want to create artificial loyalty problems. We must not forget one thing: Europe is more than growth figures and foreign trade statistics and also more than the mere maximization of affluence. Europe is a cultural area. Whoever wants to put it together again has to restart above all the intellectual-cultural exchange. A tremendous amount of things still have to be done in this respect. Personally, I very much deplore the fact that we have relatively few funds for this purpose at a time when we have problems and difficulties. Above all I deplore it so much because we -- this has often been said in the Bundestag -- have an enormous chance as far as our language is concerned. It is not unimportant for the Germans -- it is particularly striking for me as their foreign minister -- that colleagues, friends, and partners who speak German come from these countries to the numerous conferences that we hold and where French and English have hitherto been the only languages. This is a chance that we should use. I ask the German Bundestag again to help me when money is at issue and to give a proper impetus. [passage omitted]']"

He believes Germany is being viewed critically due to its past, but there is no reason to be overly cautious.', ' Ilan Mor, spokesman of the Israeli Embassy in Bonn, expresses his concern over the attack on a synagogue in Luebeck, Germany and believes that anti-Semitism exists in the country. He mentions an opinion poll which showed that 22% of people do not want a Jewish neighbor and emphasizes that Israel is closely monitoring events in Germany due to the events of 1933 and 1945.', ' German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is in a confrontation with Turkey over arms shipments, which must be used for defense within the NATO alliance. Hans-Ulrich Klose criticized Kohl for allowing the row to get out of hand. Meanwhile, the number of foreigners seeking political asylum in Germany has reached a record high of 35,000, with refugees from Yugoslavia, Romania, and Turkey making up the majority. In response to unrest in the Kurdish area, Turkey is introducing economic reforms to address the Kurdish problem.', ' The UK and Spain are seeking a legally binding protocol from Germany to give countries with 23-27 votes an automatic right to delay decisions, which could delay the entry of four new countries into the European Union. Greece has criticized the UK\\'s stance as \"blackmail of a tiny minority\".', ' German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel spoke to the Bundestag in support of Russian President Yeltsin and the need for Russia to be integrated into the world economy. He also called for increased cultural exchange between European countries, with a focus on German language, and for more funds to be allocated to this purpose. He asked the Bundestag to provide the necessary support.'], \"402\\tWhat is happening in the field of behavioral genetics, the study of the relative influence of genetic and environmental factors on an individual's behavior or personality?\": [' A landmark study on identical twins raised apart has found that genetics play a much larger role in shaping behavior than family environment. The study, published in the journal Science, found that 70% of intelligence quotient, 50% of personality differences, 50% of religiosity, and 40% of job interest variations are accounted for by genes. The Minnesota study of identical twins, begun in 1979, has revealed many eerie similarities between reunited twins and has been able to quantify the contribution of genetics to personality and behavior, while also emphasizing the importance of environment in child development.', ' Susan Hodge, a biomathemetician and geneticist, experienced anxiety and fear while waiting for the results of her amniocentesis test during her third pregnancy at age 40. Her story highlights the emotional toll genetic testing can take on couples, and the difficult decisions they must make. Research studies have shown that both amniocentesis and CVS produce anxiety reactions in women, but CVS carries a higher risk of spontaneous abortion and may not be as reliable as amniocentesis. Despite the emotional rollercoaster, Hodge eventually found peace.', ' The Office of Science and Technology Policy is proposing the establishment of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, a FACA committee that will provide advice and recommendations on bioethical issues arising from research on human biology and behavior.

Comments on the proposed charter must be received by October 11, 1994.', '\\n\\nIrish researchers have found evidence that left-handedness may be determined in the womb, as fetuses as early as 15 weeks after conception display a preference for sucking their left thumbs. Follow-up observations of 17 fetuses showed that the preference was maintained during pregnancy, suggesting that handedness is genetically determined.', ' Clifford Grobstein\\'s book \"Science & the Unborn\" divides life in the womb into six distinct phases: genetic, developmental, functional, behavioral, psychic, and social. The genetic phase begins at conception and the unborn develops its \"hereditary uniqueness.\" The developmental phase is when the pre-embryo attaches to the uterine wall and becomes committed to the production of a single individual. The functional phase is when the embryo has developed certain abilities essential to survival. The behavioral phase is when the unborn exhibits various types of behavior. The psychic phase is when a \"sense of self\" is believed to exist. The social phase is when social individuality is conferred through recognition by others.'], '403\\tFind information on the effects of the dietary intakes of potassium, magnesium and fruits and vegetables as determinants of bone mineral density in elderly men and women thus preventing osteoporosis (bone decay).': [\" A new study has found that the drug etidronate, used to treat Paget's disease and a bone disorder in cancer patients, can halve the rate of vertebral fractures in women with osteoporosis. The drug is sold under the brand name Didronel and the manufacturer is applying to the FDA for approval to use the drug to treat osteoporosis. The study also found that the drug increased spinal bone density by an average of 4-5%. Further studies are needed to explore the drug's long-term effects and to compare its effectiveness to other osteoporosis treatments.\", ' Australian researchers have found that daughters of women with osteoporosis are more likely to develop the disease than those whose mothers do not have it, suggesting that genetics may be a factor in its development. The study compared 32 women with mothers who had osteoporosis to 22 women with mothers who did not, and found that the former had thinner bones.', ' This document explains the relationship between calcium intake and osteoporosis, and outlines the process for filing a claim and the hearing process. It emphasizes the importance of adequate calcium intake throughout life for reducing the risk of osteoporosis, particularly for adolescent and young adult Caucasian and Asian American women. It also states that other factors, such as sex, race, age, exercise, and diet, are important for reducing the risk of osteoporosis.', ' This document outlines the process for submitting a health claim to the FSIS and the regulations that must be followed if the claim is approved or denied. It also explains the relationship between calcium and osteoporosis, and the significance of calcium intake in reducing the risk of developing the disease. Additionally, it mentions other risk factors such as sex, race, hormonal status, family history, body stature, level of exercise, general diet, and lifestyle choices. A health claim associating calcium with reduced risk of osteoporosis may be made on the label or labeling of a poultry product, but must make clear that adequate calcium intake is not the only risk factor.', '\\nResearchers have found that an experimental treatment involving slow-release sodium fluoride and calcium supplements can help strengthen the backbones of women with spinal fractures due to osteoporosis. This treatment has been found to increase spinal bone by 3-6% a year and decrease the frequency of spinal fractures, but it is not effective for fractures of the hip or other long bones.'], '404\\tHow often were the peace talks in Ireland delayed or disrupted as a result of acts of violence?': [\" This document examines the current deadlock in the British-Irish peace talks, which is largely attributed to Britain's preconditions for Sinn Fein's involvement. It is suggested that the presence of British troops and the Protestant majority in Northern Ireland are major impediments to the peace process. The document also suggests that both sides have gained valuable experience from their struggles over the past two decades, and that they should present peaceful views in order to move the talks forward.\", \" Michael Ancram has acknowledged that a political settlement in Northern Ireland is unlikely without the IRA accepting the Downing Street Declaration. The British and Irish governments are continuing to pursue a predominantly internal settlement, and Sir Patrick Mayhew has proposed new institutions of joint co-operation between the North and South of Ireland. The Ulster Unionists are willing to accept British representatives from a Northern Ireland assembly, provided that Northern Ireland's sovereignty remains intact.\", ' Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds is meeting with British Prime Minister John Major this weekend to discuss the progress of their peace initiative in Northern Ireland. He will then visit the United States next month to present a balanced view on the Downing Street declaration and discuss the resumed inter-party talks process with President Clinton and congressional leaders.', \" Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds and British Prime Minister John Major met in London to discuss the future of Northern Ireland. They agreed to resume the three-strand Northern Ireland talks process based on the principles enshrined in the Downing Street peace declaration. John Hume of the SDLP believes that peace in Ireland should be above party politics and that the British Government should clarify any questions the organization has about the Declaration. The organization's initial reaction was suspicion, but they have not rejected the Declaration.\", ' The British government has proposed a peace plan for Northern Ireland, which focuses on the establishment of a Northern Ireland assembly and the revitalisation of local government. Initial reaction from Unionists suggests that further concessions may be necessary to get the parties to the negotiating table. The Ulster Unionist Party has welcomed the prospect of fresh proposals, but has called for the plan to be discussed in bilateral meetings. The government has ruled out any contact with Sinn Fein until the IRA declares an unconditional ceasefire.'], '405\\tWhat unexpected or unexplained cosmic events or celestial phenomena, such as radiation and supernova outbursts or new comets, have been detected?': [' This document looks at the high-energy charged-particle fluxes that come with solar flares and their impact on biological objects and hardware during spaceflight. It classifies solar cosmic ray events by magnitude of total proton fluence and uses power-law functions to describe the energy spectra of peak proton fluxes and proton fluences. It also compares the average energy spectra of solar cosmic ray events to those of CREME and finds that they have large, high-energy particle fluxes.', ' JAERI and NASDA have studied the single event effect, which is the main cause of semiconductor breakdowns in space. An experiment on an integrated circuit memory chip revealed that breakdowns increased when heavy ion penetration exceeded LET 2.8. JAERI was also able to measure the speed of the single event phenomenon, which was found to be in the hundreds of picoseconds.', \" This article examines the sources of radiation in interplanetary space, including galactic cosmic rays, solar-flare cosmic rays, and recurrent fluxes of low-energy particles from the Sun. It presents a forecast method for flare precursors in the optical, radio, and x-ray ranges, and demonstrates that proton flares arise from processes that involve the solar surface, interplanetary space, the Earth's magnetosphere, and magnetic field, and the generation of particles in near-Earth space.\", ' In his book \"The Coming of the Cosmic Christ,\" Matthew Fox proposes that the salvation of Mother Earth lies in a renewed awareness of the Cosmic Christ, and calls for a recovery of a feminist spirituality that has been repressed for centuries. He identifies and critiques obstacles to this recovery, such as Fall/Redemption theology and patriarchy, and suggests renewing worship practices. The Vatican has responded by enforcing a year of silence on Fox, but this may not be the best solution.', ' This document investigates the energy deposits in integrated chips caused by particles in the Feng Yun-1 (B) satellite environment. It examines the LET of Galactic Cosmic-Ray components 1-28, Galactic Cosmic-Ray anomaly components (C, N, O, Ne, Ar, Fe), and inner radiation-belt protons, and calculates the SEU ratios produced by these particles.'], \"406\\tWhat is being done to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and keep the patient functional as long as possible?\": [\" Researchers from UC Davis have suggested that some cases of Parkinson's disease may be caused by infection from a common soil fungus called Nocardia asteroides. If proven, this could lead to new ways of preventing the disease, such as immunization. Other Parkinson's researchers are cautious in their assessment of the results, but agree that it is an intriguing finding. Beaman and Kohbata from Gifu University in Japan are looking for traces of Nocardia infection in Parkinson's victims, but more research is needed to determine if it is a cause.\", \" In a trial involving 54 patients with Parkinson's disease, researchers Langston and Tetrud found that the drug deprenyl nearly doubled the time between the onset of the disease and the need for therapy with the commonly used drug L-dopa. The drug is scheduled to be marketed next month and a larger study of deprenyl is expected in late 1990. The $10-million DATATOP study is also underway to determine if Vitamin E can slow the disease.\", \" Scientists have discovered a blood cell defect in people with Parkinson's disease, which could help identify victims before symptoms appear. The findings, published in the Annals of Neurology, were the result of federally funded research at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center and suggest that the disease affects more than just the brain cells it kills.\", \"\\n\\nResearchers have discovered that the drug deprenyl can slow the progression of Parkinson's disease and should be used in all patients with early stages of the illness. It has been found to delay the onset of advanced symptoms by at least one year and is safe, with 500,000 Americans suffering from the degenerative disease of the nervous system.\", \" Researchers at UCSD have developed a new technique to treat Parkinson's disease in rats by grafting genetically engineered skin cells into their brains. This technique is not as effective as the current therapy, which involves grafting brain cells from aborted fetuses, but it offers a more ethical alternative.\"], \"407\\tWhat is the impact of poaching on the world's various wildlife preserves?\": [\" Richard E. Leakey, a world-renowned paleontologist, author, and conservationist, was appointed to the Department of Wildlife Conservation and Management in Kenya to help protect the country's wildlife from poaching and other threats. His appointment follows a surge of poaching in Kenya's national parks, which has reduced the elephant population from 140,000 to 22,000. Leakey has been outspoken about the need to protect Kenya's wildlife, and his appointment is seen as a major step forward in the effort to protect the country's wildlife.\", ' Richard Leakey, a prominent figure in wildlife conservation and anti-poaching efforts in East Africa, resigned from the Kenya Wildlife Service after a two week smear campaign. The government has launched an investigation into Leakey and the KWS Service, due to his resistance to land grabbing by politicians. His associates and friends admit that he can be abrasive and arrogant, but he has also been credited with restoring international credibility to the Kenyan wildlife department.', ' 11 people were arrested Tuesday for their involvement in a poaching ring that killed over 400 black bears in the Northeast for their gall bladders. The arrests were the result of a 2 1/2-year investigation by wildlife officials.', ' The African elephant population has been in decline due to poaching and ivory trading, but in 1989 CITES banned the trade in ivory. At the upcoming CITES conference in Kyoto, Japan, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Malawi are pushing to resume the buying and selling of ivory and other elephant products. Conservationists fear that ending the ban will lead to a new wave of poaching, while the countries pushing for the ban believe that effective management of native elephant herds has led to flourishing populations. A possible compromise is to trade in meat and skins instead of ivory, but this is not seen as binding enough. African states are now collaborating and major donors are willing to fund elephant programmes, but the fate of elephants lies in the hands of African peoples.', ' Wildlife specialists from over 100 countries are meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland to discuss the African elephant population crisis. The delegates of CITES must find a compromise between the East African demand for an ivory ban and the position that controlled marketing of tusks can finance anti-poaching measures. CITES rulings are non-binding and rely on international pressure for enforcement.'], '408\\tWhat tropical storms (hurricanes and typhoons) have caused significant property damage and loss of life?': [' Tropical Storm Lili veered away from the mid-Atlantic coast, while the remnants of two other storms caused flooding from the Carolinas to Pennsylvania.

The US believes Iran ordered the bombing in retaliation for the accidental shooting down of an Iranian Airbus in 1988.', ' Rep. James A. Traficant Jr. (D-Ohio) has revealed a report claiming that CIA operatives in West Germany may have had prior knowledge of the bomb that exploded on Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, killing 270 people. He has not revealed how he obtained the report.', \" The President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism released a report on Tuesday recommending the US retaliate against acts of terrorism with military strikes or other punitive steps. The report found that Pan Am and the FAA had failed to enforce security regulations that could have prevented the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988, and recommended halting deployment of bomb detectors in airports. The commission also recommended the US take aggressive steps to strike back against terrorists and their sponsors, even if available evidence falls short of criminal standards of proof.\"], '410\\tWho is involved in the Schengen agreement to eliminate border controls in Western Europe and what do they hope to accomplish?': [\" The Schengen Executive Committee met in Bonn on 26 April 1994 to discuss further measures to be taken in the gradual abolition of personal controls at internal borders. The Committee agreed on measures to be taken, such as the removal of traffic obstacles and lifting of traffic restrictions at border crossing points. They also adopted a regulation concerning unified visa issuance procedures and a protocol to replace the provisions of the Schengen Agreement concerning the granting of political asylum. The Executive Committee also adopted an interim report on the state of talks on Austria's observer status and called on the chairman to continue negotiations with Austria.\", ' The Senate fact-finding mission concluded that the Schengen agreement, which eliminates internal borders and allows for free movement of people and goods within the EU, is inapplicable due to difficulties in establishing the Schengen Information System (SIS).

Despite this, the village will still benefit from tax advantages until 1995. The accord has been delayed until mid-year due to companies not being ready for the complex new VAT system, and passport checks are likely to remain in place in the UK, Denmark and Ireland beyond the January deadline. The Schengen border crossing is set to be unmanned for the first time since 1839 on December 31.', ' The Schengen Information System is set to go into operation in October, making it easier to search for criminals and rejected asylum-seekers. The Schengen Accord will come into force when the system is put into operation, with reduced identity checks at the inland borders and increased checks at the external borders.

With a third successive good crop, Australia is hoping to take the number one position this year, as Cuba's sugar production is expected to fall to 4m tonnes.\", \" Cuba's sugar harvest has been in decline for the past five years, resulting in lost export earnings of $1bn. Contributing factors include input shortages, unseasonal weather, and declining efficiency. The Cuban government is attempting to maximize production with a short, sharp harvest and requiring all mills to join the harvest. The productivity of the cane co-operatives has been poor due to lack of incentives, delays in promised benefits, and shortages of work clothes. Cuba is considering introducing greater material incentives for sugar workers and may have to roll over many of its commitments into the next crop period.\"], '415\\tWhat is known about drug trafficking in the \"Golden Triangle\", the area where Burma, Thailand and Laos meet?': [' On October 26th, representatives from Laos, China, Myanmar, and Thailand met at the UN headquarters in New York to sign a memorandum to increase cooperation in controlling drugs in the Golden Triangle area of Southeast Asia.

Codan, Denmark's biggest non-life insurance group, recorded a net loss of DKr146m in the same period, compared to a profit of DKr503m the previous year.\", \" Peter Weitermeyer, the CEO of J. Lauritzen Shipping, resigned abruptly yesterday. The company has been struggling financially due to the weak dollar and the EU's quota restrictions on banana imports from South America. Claus V. Ipsen, the former finance manager, has taken over from Mr Weitermeyer.\", ' Lauritzen Holding, a Danish company, plans to float its subsidiaries on the stock exchange in order to reduce its stake in them to 52%. The company reported a first-half loss of DKr198m this year, and Lauritzen Shipping made a pre-tax loss of DKr240m in the first half.', ' Bristol Channel Ship Repairers reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 236,261 for the 28 weeks to October 9, due to the recession and difficult conditions in the shipping industry. Turnover fell significantly and losses per share amounted to 0.3p. A 24% stake in the company was taken by a Norwegian shipping group last July, which could result in the chairman stepping down.', \" Skaugen, a major Norwegian shipowner, reported a pre-tax loss of NKr170m in 1991, compared to a profit of NKr68m in 1990. This was attributed to lower chartering rates and weaker markets, and the company reduced its fleet to 52 ships from 85. Managing director Erik Gloeersen predicted a difficult year in 1992 with lower earnings in several of the company's ship divisions.\"], '449\\tWhat has caused the current ineffectiveness of antibiotics against infections and what is the prognosis for new drugs?': [' Calgene conducted experiments to determine if APH(3 隆炉)II in fresh tomatoes could render orally-administered kanamycin ineffective. The results showed that APH(3 隆炉)II would be degraded before it could inactivate the antibiotics. The FDA evaluated the data and concluded that any active APH(3 隆炉)II would not significantly inactivate kanamycin or neomycin due to the small amount of ATP in fruits and vegetables. Therefore, the presence of alkaline phosphatase in food will not affect the therapeutic use of orally administered kanamycin or neomycin.', \" Merck & Co, the world's largest pharmaceuticals group, has warned that European governments' efforts to cut drugs bills are ineffective and counter-productive. David Anstice, Merck's senior vice-president for European human health, suggested that savings could be made in distribution and dispensing, and that structural changes were required in healthcare delivery in order to control health spending more effectively.\", \" Pneumonia is an infection of the lung tissue caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, chemical agents, or allergic reactions and is the sixth leading cause of death in the US. Jim Henson's death from pneumonia last week is a reminder that this usually benign disease can be fatal. Symptoms of pneumonia can vary, but include fever, chest pain, cough, and shortness of breath. A vaccine for pneumococcal pneumonia was developed in 1977 and is recommended for the elderly and those with immune-system problems. Despite tragic exceptions, such as Jim Henson's death, pneumonia can usually be detected and treated quickly.\", \" This article examines the issue of noncompliance with medical advice and prescriptions, which is a significant problem facing doctors today. It looks at the reasons why people may not follow doctors' orders, such as troublesome side effects, high cost of drugs, and complex instructions, as well as the potential dangers of not following medical advice. It suggests that doctors should consider the financial constraints of their patients when prescribing medication, and that medical technology and pharmaceutical firms have developed a variety of shortcuts to ensure patients receive the maximum benefit of a medicine for a minimum of effort. Finally, it suggests that doctors should try to understand the need for individuals with a chronic illness to assert some personal control over that illness through their medications.\", ' This document discusses the potential transfer of the kan r gene from crops to microorganisms and the potential health risks associated with it. It concludes that the transfer of the kan r gene from plants to microbes will not occur at a detectable frequency and will not result in a significant increase in the numbers of antibiotic-resistant microbes, and that there will be no significant increase in the antibiotic-resistant microorganism population of the soil. It also states that the claim that the kan r gene could be transferred from plants to bacteria by plasmids is without basis.'], '450\\tHow significant a figure over the years was the late Jordanian King Hussein in furthering peace in the Middle East?': [\" King Hussein of Jordan expresses his frustration and fears for the Middle East peace process, citing the lack of unity among Arab nations and the failure to coordinate with Israel. He expresses his disappointment at the opportunities missed and foreboding about the future, and his reluctance to sign a separate peace deal with Israel. He will travel to Washington to meet with President Bill Clinton and receive the results of a medical test, but is unable to summon much optimism about the health of the Arab world's body politic. Relations with Egypt remain cool and the king was snubbed by King Fahd during a recent trip to Saudi Arabia, though the favour of western allies is returning slowly.\", \" Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem held strikes and rallies in protest of the Israel-Jordan peace treaty, which recognizes Jordan's custodial role over Islamic sites in Jerusalem. The PLO and Hamas joined forces in the rare display of unity, while Israeli troops dispersed stone-throwers. Palestinians are outraged at the treaty and have appealed to the UN for support to overturn the parts of the treaty relating to Jerusalem. The Financial Times London reported on the deal between Jordan and Israel that could lead to Israeli domination in the Middle East.\", ' King Hussein of Jordan called for dialogue with Iraq to resolve the Persian Gulf crisis, but French President Francois Mitterrand insisted that Iraq must first withdraw from Kuwait. King Hussein also highlighted the need to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and noted that Jordan was abiding by U.N. trade sanctions despite its former reliance on Iraqi oil.', \" King Hussein of Jordan flew to Baghdad on Thursday to meet with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, and Yemen's leader Col. Ali Abdullah Saleh for a summit meeting of the Arab Cooperation Council in Amman on February 24th. The summit will focus on Middle East peace and the foreign relations between Iraq and Jordan.\", ' King Hussein of Jordan and President Assad of Syria held talks in Damascus to discuss their response to the surprise Palestinian deal with Israel. Both leaders were displeased with the lack of consultation before the agreement and feared Yassir Arafat had conceded too much. The talks were aimed at uniting a response with Syria and both countries are unlikely to make declarations of principles towards a full peace with Israel without first understanding the details of the agreement.']}\n"
